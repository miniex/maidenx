# MaidenX Tensor

## Current Limitations

- Currently only supports a single computation graph
- Sequential execution only (no parallel execution)

## Future Plans

- Support for multiple computation graphs
- Parallel execution of graph operations
- Performance optimizations for computation graph execution
